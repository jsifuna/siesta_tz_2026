# Welcome to the SIESTA school in DODOMA - 2026
### 🧪 East-African School on Density Functional Theory and its Applications – SIESTA @ University of Dodoma


Welcome to the GitHub repository for the **East-African School on Density Functional Theory (DFT) and its Applications**, with a special focus on the **SIESTA** code. This school is a regional initiative to introduce participants to *first-principles simulations*, *molecular dynamics*, and modern tools like *AI-assisted materials discovery*.

> **📍 Hosted at the University of Dodoma**  
> 🗓️ **June 22–26, 2026**  
> 🖥️ **Hands-on training with the SIESTA code**  
> 🧠 **Explore quantum simulations from first principles**

## 🧬 What is SIESTA?

SIESTA (Spanish Initiative for Electronic Simulations with Thousands of Atoms) is a well-established **Density Functional Theory (DFT)** code used for ab initio simulations of materials at the atomic scale. It enables efficient simulations of large systems, with broad applications in physics, chemistry, material science, and engineering.
